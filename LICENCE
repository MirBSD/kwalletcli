KDE Oxygen theme icons is a special kind of software library, it
is an artwork library, it's elements can be used in a Graphical
User Interface, or GUI. Source code, for this library means:
where they exist, SVG; otherwise, if applicable, the multi-layered
formats XCF or PSD, or otherwise PNG.

The LGPL in some sections obliges you to make the files carry
notices. With images this is in some cases impossible or hardly useful.

With this library a notice is placed at a prominent place in the
directory containing the elements. You may follow this practice.

The exception in section 5 of the GNU Lesser General Public License
covers the use of elements of this art library in a GUI.
